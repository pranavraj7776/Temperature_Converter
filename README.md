A Simple Temperature Converter is a web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The interface is designed with basic HTML for the input fields and buttons, styled using CSS for an intuitive and user-friendly appearance. JavaScript handles the core functionality, performing the temperature conversion when the user inputs a value and selects the conversion type.
